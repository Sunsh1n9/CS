                                                - System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)
The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user
access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an
organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover
confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety.
Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

ANALYZE AUDIT RESULTS 

Review the controls assessment and compliance checklist you completed in “Conduct a security audit, part 1” and consider the following, before moving on to the next step:

    What were the audit scope and goals? 
- THe scope of the internal audit was the assessment of current user permissions set, current implemented controls, current procedures and protocols for the following systems: accounting,
end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information
and Event Management (SIEM) tool. I also needed to ensure that current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place
align with necessary compliance requirement, and that the technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.
- The goals were: 
● To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework (NIST CSF)
● Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant
● Fortify system controls
● Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential
management
● Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks
● Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements


    What were the critical findings of the audit that need to be addressed immediately (i.e., What controls and/or policies need to be implemented immediately)?
- The audit showed that adressing some controls is critical, like: 
Least Privilege 
Disaster recovery plans 
Password policies 
Access control policies 
Separation of duties 
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
Backups 
Antivirus (AV) software 
Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention 
Lock of physical assets 

    What were the findings (i.e., What controls and/or policies that need to be addressed in the future)?
- For the future: 
Account management policies 
Encryption 
Password management system 
And other physical controls

    How can you summarize your recommendations clearly and concisely to stakeholders?
- My recommendation is to implement the necessary controls and policies as sooon as possible, and to hire skilled individual to help achieve the security goals of the organization.
- The security posture or the organiization needs to be strenghten with no delay to avoid sanctions, fines, loss of private data and, therefore, also bad reputation.
